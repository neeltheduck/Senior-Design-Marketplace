You can use this if they try to access a route that they should not be able to. You will redirect them here. For
example, if they go to /user without being logged in, or they try to access /admin without beinging logged in or
they are not an admin user. You don't HAVE to use this template, you can display errors and respond with status codes on
the pages with the forms themselves. You can use this if you wish though.Â
